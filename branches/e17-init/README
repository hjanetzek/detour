detour 0.1.1 (init) series

Detour has been in the works since September of 2005. It began as a port of the detroit Enlightenment-DR16 theme. The differences in the color scheme, design and goals were so different , that it was no longer a port, rather it became a detour. 

Detour logo is based on the CLUB font by Marcio Hirosse.
