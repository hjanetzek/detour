- Currently the drag an object and drop animation is shared between the 
  desktop window and the file manager. There needs to be a color scheme 
  separation between the filemanager and its background. This depends 
  heavily on what the future has stored for efm.

- Text_Classes are a touchy subject. No doubt, they are easy to add, but the
  default text_classes have an undesired effect on the interface. This is 
  why they are not in use. Titlebar still not using:
	text_class: "title_bar"

  Window borders
  - This is one of biggest overhauls. It will happen, it will have 
    considerate effect on the interface's color scheme. Some people have 
    mentioned that detour is missing color, too gray. This is the item that 
    lays the foundation 

- In some scenarios the scrollframe overlaps tlist/ilist text items.

- Need to finish invisible shelf and insets.

- There are various signals which are not currently in use. Such as:
  e,state,hung|unhung (window borders)
  e,state,hidden|visible (shelf)

- The transition dialog needs to use its own images. Raster suggests using
  some subtle.

  Gadman 
  - Needs to be designed.

  cpufreq 
  - Needs to be designed.

- Clock module needs to be re-designed. Aspect ration and scaling is way off.

  Wallpaper 
  - Needs to be designed.

- Eventually support color_classes. Albeit i think the dialog needs a 
  design implementation redo. 

- Missing icons:
  "arrange_name" "arrange" "arrange_time" "view_details" "view_name"
  "view"
