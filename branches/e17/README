detour 0.6.0 (seek)

This is an edje for the Enlightenment 0.17.0 Window Manager 
currently in development. (http://enlightenment.org)

Detour has been in the works since March of 2005. It began as a port of the Enlightenment-DR16 detroit theme. So many changes have occurred since, that it was no longer a port, rather it became a detour. 

This project's website is: http://cored.org/prototype/detour/

NOTES: Textclasses for the titlebar and the menu labels have been explicitly disabled.

Detour has 4 build-time options available. Look at main.edc:6
