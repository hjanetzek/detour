detour 0.6.0 (seek)

This is an edje for the Enlightenment 0.17.0 Window Manager 
currently in development. (http://enlightenment.org)

Detour has been in the works since September of 2005. It began as a port of 
the Enlightenment-DR16 detroit theme. So many changes have occurred since, 
that it was no longer a port, rather it became a detour.
