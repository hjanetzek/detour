/**
 * group "etk/entry"
 * -----------------------
 * This group is used for the spinner widget. It uses several other groups:
 * - "etk/spinner/text": for the text inside the spinner
 * - "etk/spinner/cursor": for the cursor of the spinner
 * - "etk/spinner/selection" for the selection of the spinner
 *
 * Signals:
 * --------
 * - common widget's signals: "etk,state,enter", "etk,state,leave", "etk,state,shown",
 *      "etk,state,focused", "etk,state,unfocused", "etk,state,enabled", "etk,state,disabled"
 *
 * Signals to emit:
 * ----------------
 * - "etk,action,increment,start": should be emitted when the value of spinner should start being incremented
 *      (usually when the up-arrow is pressed)
 * - "etk,action,increment,stop": should be emitted when the value of spinner should stop being incremented
 *      (usually when the up-arrow is released)
 * - "etk,action,decrement,start": should be emitted when the value of spinner should start being decremented
 *      (usually when the down-arrow is pressed)
 * - "etk,action,decrement,stop": should be emitted when the value of spinner should stop being decremented
 *      (usually when the down-arrow is released)

/**
 * group "etk/spinner/cursor"

 * This group corresponds to the text-cursor of the spinner
 *
 * Signals:
 * --------
 * - "etk,action,show,cursor": this signal is emitted each time the cursor should become visible (when the spinner is
 *      focused or when the cursor is moved). Note that the blinking of the cursor should still be done by the theme
 *
 * Current implementation: alias of "etk/entry/cursor", see entry.edc

/**
 * group "etk/spinner/selection"
 * -----------------------
 * This group corresponds to the selection rectangle used by the spinner
 *
 * Different settings:
 * -------------------
 * - "on_foreground": a boolean indicating whether the selection should be stacked above or below the text of the spinner.
 *      If "on_foreground" is "1", the selection will be stacked above the text, otherwise it will be stacked below.
 *      Default value is "0"
